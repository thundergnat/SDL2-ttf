Make sure you have libsdl2-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev installed.

On Debian derived distributions:

    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

or similar for others.



Not installable with zef right now. Until color handling is resolved, not really worth it.

For local testing:

Download SDL2-ttf.p6 module and ttftest.p6 script file.

Run the ttftest.p6 script in the same directory as the SDL2-ttf.pm6 module.

If colors were working correctly "Raku" should be red (RGB #FF0000) and the Camelias
should be green (RGB #00FF00).
